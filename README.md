# gtk.reds

As I think `julia` was clever to have named its package with extension `.jl` which is really easy to find on internet, I do the same for this preliminary package. `gtk.reds` is then a plugin of `gtk` for `red/system`.

If, for instance,  you have installed [reds](https://github.com/rcqls/reds) bash script, generating is as simple as:

```
reds examples/hello.reds
```
